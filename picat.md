# What I Wish I Knew When Learning Picat

July 2025

I have long been interested in constraint programming, which has been referred to as the "Holy Grail" of programming where the user states the problem and the computer solves it. https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/242224.242304

While this is far from reality, constraint programming can reduce and scan the search space for NP dynamic programming problems without the user having to explictly code the backtracking/search algorithm. Examples include: shortest path, knapsack, n-queens, Soduko and so on. 

Picat is a great language for learning these concepts and also an interesting general purpose programming language. 

My background in programming is mostly procedural (Python) and pure functional (Haskell). So my challenge with Picat is multi-faceted: 1. Learn how constraint programming works in general, 2. Learn how constraint programming works in Picat, 3. Learn how Picat works.

Because Picat is a descendent of Prolog, it's core is a logic programming paradigm. And while the Picat manual is excellent, it moves along a quick clip and I had to read it very carefully to understand what I didn't understand. Think Calculus textbook. It's all documented, but makes sense sometimes only after you've learned it.

Also, because it's a niche language, there's a limited amount of online support. There's no StackExchange/Picat. (There are a few Picat questions there though!) I was lucky to get in contact with one of the key developers/users of the language, HÃ¥kan Kjellerstrand, who kindly helped me through many a head scratching moment. He also made a customized ChatGPT with Picat's documentation that has helped me as well, although like all LLMs, it can hallucinate solutions that don't work and has a tiny  training dataset compared with JavaScript.

This document is my attempt to share what I learned and is intended for programmers who have similar experience to me. A reasonable grasp of a common language such as Python, C, JavaScript, etcc or a background with a functional language such as Haskell or OCaml, but not much use of Prolog or other logic programming language, and possibly no idea what constraint programming is. 

Consider this a rough draft representing my personal learning curve. This document is not intended to be read top to bottom, but rather to help you if you get stuck where I did and hopefully give you the insight to move forward. As such, there's some redundancy between sections because I'm trying to make them self-contained as much as possible.

Note: Title inspired by What I Wish I Knew When I was Learning Haskell, which helped me learn that language. https://github.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh

## About Picat

Picat is:

1. A dynamically typed hybrid of imperative, logic, functional and constraint programming. 
2. A programming language with support for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Finite Domain (FD) Constraint Programming (CP) solvers.
3. Combines some of the best ideas of Prolog, Python, Haskell, MiniZinc/z3, OR-Tools, COIN-OR.
3. A wonderful resource for learning logic and constraint programming.

Answer: all of the above.

## Using the Manual

https://picat-lang.org/download/picat_guide.pdf
- The manual is the single most important document for learning Picat. It has everything, but can be very terse, and so must be read closely.
- The index at the back lists all the commands and hyperlinks to them. I use this more than any other method when programming in Piact.

## Note About Example Code 

Each clause in Picat ends with a `.`. In example code each line is fully distinct for variable scope.

`%` begins a comment.

For example:

```
A=5. % A=5. 
```
But `A` only equals `5` in this clause. After the `.`, `A` goes out of scope.

And if you prefer spaces around your operators, please go ahead.

```
A="A Wildebeest!". % A is a string. 
```
Again, `A` is in scope only until the `.` and doesn't exist after.
```
B=A+A. %** Error  : Free variable in expression: '+' 
```
 `A` hasn't been defined in this clause. 
 
 But using a `,` provides a continuous scope for `A`.
```
A=5,B=A+A. %A=5 and B=10.
```

## Constraint Programming

Constraint programming let's you solve problems that require searching through possible solutions. How can you place queens on a chessboard so that no queen is able to take another? (N-queens) Can a knight on chessboard visit every square once and end by returning to its starting square? (Knights tour) The best route for a travelling salesman? (Travelling Salesman) The quickest way out of a maze? (Shortest Path) How best to choose items to fill a suitcase? (Knapsack) How to complete a partially filled Soduku puzzle? (Soduku)

All of these, and many many more can be found via the links in the references section. 

The main concept here is the minimization of a function defined by a set of rules aka constraints. The function has variables whose values are not known, but can be defined to be within a given range.

These variables can be real/floating point values or integers and, in general, real variable solutions are easier to find than integer ones. In most most cases, for integer or "mixed integer" where some of the values are integers, there's no closed form solution. Constraint progamming is NP-Hard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming#Heuristic_methods

There are many applicable techniques you may have seen in a CS algorithms class: Dijkstra's algorithm, A*, recursion/induction, A/B pruning, branch-and-bound, fail first, breadth first search, depth first search, simplex, gradient descent, satisfiability solver, memoization/tabling or just brute force.

A solution is found through iteration and any efficiency over brute force is through careful selection of which potential solution to try next, when to give up and try a different one, and identification of when a given search location is the same as a previous one. This last item is also known as symmetry breaking, that is, if a state is identical/symmetrical to a previous one, don't do the calculations all over again.

These algorithms can reduce the time to find a solution from hours to fractions of a second, but learning all of them and implementing them for a specific problem can be challenging. Enter Picat!

Picat has multiple built-in solvers: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), Finite Domain (FD) Constraint Programming (CP), and a Planner for shortest path/minimum cost. 

Incredibly, the interface to all of them is essentially the same. This lets you switch between CP and SAT, for example by just changing and `import` statement. 

### Fibonacci and Tabling

Let's take a the example every dynamic programming text begins with, Fibonacci numbers. $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. In Picat:

```
fib(0) = 1.
fib(1) = 1.
fib(N) = fib(N-1)+fib(N-2).
```
Run this with and we quickly see a problem with compute time.
```
main =>
    time(println(fib(5))),
    time(println(fib(30))),
    time(println(fib(40))).
---------------------------------
8 CPU time 0.0 seconds.
1346269 CPU time 0.042 seconds.
165580141 CPU time 4.755 seconds.
---------------------------------
```
`fib` is recalculating every value of `N-1` and `N-2` for each `N`. At `fib(40)` that's 331,160,281 recursive calls. https://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/168662-fibonacci-how-long-would-take.html

The solution is to memoize the values into a hash table after they are computed so that they can be looked up rather than brute forced on subsequent calls.

Picat (and Prolog) make this ridiculously easy. Here's the revised code.

```
main =>
    time(println(fib(5))),
    time(println(fib(30))),
    time(println(fib(40))),
    time(println(fib(4000))).

table
fib(0) = 1.
fib(1) = 1.
fib(N) = fib(N-1)+fib(N-2).

In Picat, here's a solution.

```
import cp.

main =>
    % Define the graph with nodes and edges
    Nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'S'],
    Edges = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'D'),
             ('B', 'S'),
             ('C', 'H'),
             ('D', 'S'), ('D', 'H'),
             ('S', 'I'),

### The Planner

The `planner` module is, as far as I know, unique to Picat. It lets you define a starting state, action to create the next state, the final/goal state, and then just solve it.

Planner acts as high-level interface to the underlying solver and mechanics of tabling and goal state checking.

### A Planner Example

Here's an example from the documentation for the programming language Curry, which combines functional and logic paradigms. https://curry-lang.org/docs/tutorial/html/curry-tutorial.Ch6.S1.html#SS3


>The âblocks worldâ consists of 3 possibly empty piles, labeled p, q and r, of unique blocks labeled A, B, C, etc. âStartâ and âFinalâ below are two examples from [blocks world](https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/cs2511/projects/Java/assignment6/blocks/blocks.xhtml).

![](blocksworld1.png)

![](blocksworld2.png)

>A blocks world âproblemâ consists of two worlds, like Start and Final above. Its solution consists in the moves that produce the second world from the first one. A âmoveâ transfers the block on top of a pile to the top of another pile. No other blocks are affected by the move. 

Here's a solution with the Picat `planner`.

```
import planner.

main =>
    problem(S),
    best_plan(S,Plan), % solves the problem S
    println(S[1]), % prints the first state
    foreach (Step in Plan)
        println(Step) % prints each state
    end,
    printf("Solution cost: %w\n", length(Plan)).
 
% uncomment an S to run it
problem(S) => 
    % S = [[[a,b],[],[]], [[],[a,b],[]]]. % simple
    % S = [[[a,b],[],[]], [[],[b,a],[]]].  % simple
    S = [[[a,b,c,d,e],[],[]], [[],[c,b,a,d,e],[]]]. % difficult

% the goal state
final(State), 
    problem(S),
    State[1] == S[2] => true.

% action predicate defines how to go to the next state: NextS
% Action variable is used to write the chosen step to the log

action([[S1,S2,S3]],NextS,Action,Cost) =>

    % pattern match on all the possible moves
    % this is essentially a case statement

    (
    S1 = [H1|T1], 
        NewS1 = T1,      
        NewS2 = [H1|S2], 
        NewS3 = S3,      
        Action = $("1->2",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3);

    S1 = [H1|T1], 
        NewS1 = T1,      
        NewS2 = S2,      
        NewS3 = [H1|S3], 
        Action = $("1->3",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3);

    S2 = [H2|T2], 
        NewS1 = S1,      
        NewS2 = T2,      
        NewS3 = [H2|S3], 
        Action = $("2->3",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3);

    S2 = [H2|T2], 
        NewS1 = [H2|S1], 
        NewS2 = T2,      
        NewS3 = S3,      
        Action = $("2->1",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3);

    S3 = [H3|T3], 
        NewS1 = [H3|S1], 
        NewS2 = S2,      
        NewS3 = T3,      
        Action = $("3->1",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3);

    S3 = [H3|T3], 
        NewS1 = S1,      
        NewS2 = [H3|S2], 
        NewS3 = T3, 
        Action = $("3->2",NewS1,NewS2,NewS3) 
    ),
    Cost = 1, % the cost for a given step
    NextS = [[NewS1,NewS2,NewS3]]. % the next state.

```

## Picat Isn't Python

My primary programming languages are Python and Haskell. I often make syntax errors or cause logic problems because I forget about these items below. If you come from these or a C-syntax style language, you may also need to read this.

### Variables
- Variable names must have an initial capital letter or underscore. 
- Like Prolog, Picat programmers tend towards short, often single character variable names.
- Long variable names are bi-capitalized. 
```
A = 5. % OK

_A = 5. % OK

a = 5. % Parses, but the result is 'false'. Because the atom 'a' does not unify with the number 5.

A=5,b=4. % Parses, but fails because the atom b!=4, and therefore A does not get bound to 5.

b=4;A=5. % A is bound to 5. because b!=4 and ';' means 'or'.

NoJavaVariableNamesHere=true. % OK, but this is not normal Picat style, but you live your best self however you want.
```

### Assignment (Binding) vs. Unification (Bind or Fail) vs. Equality (Only Numbers)

Here be dragons. Or at least a sharp corner to hit your head on when you realize your program is failing because you used the wrong one.

Logic programming uses the concepts of binding and unification. Binding is similar to assignment in other programming languages. Unification attempts to validate if the left and right side are the same, and if not either binds one side to the other or fails. Examples will help here.

#### Default binding

When a variable is first parsed by Picat, it is in an uninstantiated state. Trying to use it will result in an error.

```
A. %*** error(instantiation_error,call). 
```

However, it can be accessed because Picat will instantiate an unbounded variable that points to an empty memory location. 

```
println(A). % If A hasn't been defined/bound then _3d084e8 (or some other memory address) 
```

#### Unification: the `=` and `is` operators

The `=` operator performs one function that looks like two. It can assign a variable to an expression for it's first use and it can check the equality of a variable and an expression on subsequent uses. But these are both the same operation: unification. 

Unification is central to logic programming, but it also underlies type inference, type checking and pattern matching in functional programming languages such as Haskell and OCaml. However, unless you have tried to build a type inference engine, you are unlikey to have heard the term used in functional programming. 

Unification results either in success/true/yes or fail/false/no. The slash here indicates these are the synonyms. The evaluation results in success or failure, the logical value of the evaluation for each respectively is true/false and the Picat interpreter will output `yes` or `no` to indicate this.

Key point: a successful unification results in an unbound variable being bound. Let's look at some examples.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** The explict and central use of unification is the main difference between Prolog and almost all other programming languages. 

Picat makes it easier for people coming from non-logic programming backgrounds by including functions (see below), `foreach` loops and list comprehensions. 

However, Picat is still a member of the Prolog family and as such, understanding how unification works is required for anything but the simplest program.

*Rabbit Hole: Mercury is a functional/logic language that includes unification. Unlike Picat, it is purely function and strongly typed. https://mercurylang.org/ Verse is also functional/logic, but is not yet publicly available except for programming games such as Fortnight. Yes, really. https://files.gotocon.com/uploads/slides/conference_65/2896/original/GOTO.pdf*

```
A=5, println(A). % A is bound to the value 5, and the unification succeeds allowing the statement to print 5. 

5=A, println(A). % A is bound to 5 because unification is bidirectional. <- IMPORTANT
```

Read the above as 
 1. `A` points to an empty memory location as a default binding.
 2. The default binding can be made/shown to be equivalent to `5` through unification.
 3. The unification binds `5` to `A` at the memory address.
 4. `,` means the logical and operation. 
 5. Because the left side of the `,` is true we can output the value of memory address of `A` to the terminal.
 6. As noted above `A=5` is identical to `5=A` because unification is bidirectional. <- Important

Compare this with:

```
A=5, A=3, println(A). % Fails/false/no. 
```

Read the above as:
1. `A=5 `binds/unifies/assigns `5` to `A`. 
2. `A=3` attempts to unify `A` with `3`. This fails `5` cannot be made to equal `3`.
3. Because step 2 is false, the overall `,` clause is false and the `println` doesn't happen.
4. The entire clause fails. `A` will not be bound to `5` after this clause! <- Important

```
A=5, A!=3, println(A). % Succeeds/true/yes.

A!=3, A=5, println(A). % Fails/false/no.
```

`!=` is "not unifiy". In the first line above `A` does get bound to `5`. The second line fails because for `A!=3` the variable `A` has not been instantiated or bound to a value and therefore cannot be unified with `3`.

Now look at this. Did you expect it?

```
A=B, println([A,B]). % A and B point to the same memory -> [_10a58,_10a58] 

B=5,A=B, println(A). % B unifies/binds to 5, A binds to B, A is 5 -> 5.

A=B,B=5, println(A) % B unifies with A, B binds to 5, A is now 5. <- Important
```

Above is a two variable example. Both left and right in `A=B` are unbound variables, which means the unification points them to same memory location. Therefore whenever A or B gets bound to a value A will be also.

`is` comes from Prolog and is for unifying on numeric values only. It allows binding across integer and float numeric data types. I have never found a reason to use it instead of `=`.

```
 A is 5. % A is bound to 5.
 
 5.0 is 5 % Succeds/true/yes. Equivalent to =.= below.
 ```

#### Equality: the `==` and `=:=` operators

If you want to test equality without unifying or binding, then `==` does this, just like Python or JavaScript. (Well, not like JavaScript, which has `===` and more rabbit holes about equality.)

```
A=5,A==5. % Succeeds/true/yes

A==5. % Fails/false/no. Picat provides the amusing error: ** Warning: superfluous call to ==

A=3,A!==5. % Succeeds/true/yes

A=5,A!==5. % Fails/false/no. A is not bound to 5. <- Important
```

Note: Two terms can be equivalent with `==` even if they don't point to the same memory.

Numerical equality can also be checked with `=:=`, which considers float and interger types the same and allows for a difference of 0.00000001. Also, not numerically equal is `=\=`. For example:

```
5=5.0 % Fails/false/no

5=:=5.0 % Succeeds/true/yes

5=:=5.1 % Fails/false/no

5=:=5.000001 % Fails/false/no

5=:=5.000000000001 % Succeeds/true/yes

5=\=6 % Succeeds/true/yes
```

#### Assignment: The `:=` operator, `bind_vars()` 

To force the binding of a value to a variable, `:=` is the operator. Variables in Picat are mutable, meaning `:=` overwrites the previous value. `bind_vars()` lets you assign a value to a structure such as a list or array. Some examples.

```
A:=5. % A is bound to 5.

A=3,A:=5. % A is bound to 5.

A:=5,A=3. % Fails/false/no. A is not bound to 5.

A=new_list(5), bind_vars(A,"b"). A = [[b],[b],[b],[b],[b]]

A=new_array(2,3), bind_vars(A,0). A = {{0,0,0},{0,0,0}}
```

### Program Structure and Control Flow

Picat programs consist of statements which can be combined into longer clauses inside procedures or functions. Picat statements are either rules or facts. This is more correct than thinking of them as statements because all of the rules and facts are stored in a database of the program. This is also how Prolog works.

Fun fact: Because a program is a database, you can alter the rules and facts on the fly with `cl_facts`. See the later of this section for a perfectly legitimate abuse of this.


#### The `main` function.

The default entry point for a Picat program is a `main` function. If you call a Picat program from the command line, `main` will be run unless you overrride it.

Also, the standard file extension for Picat is `.pi`.

```
% hello.pi
main => println("Hello Picat!").
```

Then run it from a terminal.
```
picat hello.pi
Hello Picat!
```

#### Whitespace

Whitespace does not matter except for one space needed after the end of clauses Picat doesn't care if you smush everything together.

#### Predicates vs. Functions 

A key difference of Picat vs. Prolog is the inclusion of functions. In Prolog, everything is a predicate and there's no direct concept of a "returned value". 

The classic example of this is Prolog's `append` predicate, which Picat also has and it let's you join two lists. It takes the form `append(L1,L2,L3)`. Note the standard use of terse variable names. 

```
append([1,2],[3,4],L3). % L3 = [1,2,3,4].
```

But `L1`, `L2`, and `L3` are not the "output" of the predicate. You can also write this:

```
append(L1,[3,4],[1,2,3,4]). % L1 = [1,2].
```

OK, that's not like Python at all. And it gets weirder. Type this into the Picat interpreter.

```
Picat> append(L1,L2,[1,2,3,4]).
L1 = '[]'
L2 = [1,2,3,4] ?

```
This means `[1,2,3,4]` can be formed by an empty `L1` and `L2` being the same as `L3`. And then there's this `?`. Picat is asking if you want more. If you enter `;`, which means "or", the output continues with all possibilities until there are no more, which is indicated with `no`.


```
Picat> append(L1,L2,[1,2,3,4]).
L1 = '[]'
L2 = [1,2,3,4] ?;
L1 = [1]
L2 = [2,3,4] ?;
L1 = [1,2]
L2 = [3,4] ?;
L1 = [1,2,3]
L2 = [4] ?;
L1 = [1,2,3,4]
L2 = '[]' ?;

no
```

Technically what is happening here is unification, which we discussed earlier. Unification allows for non-deterministic behavior, which we will go into futher later. But the key point here is what would it be like to write a program with nothing but predicates that work this way? 

Picat has all of this Prolog-stype behavior, but with functions it's more explicit what the input and output of a called object are. You can use `append` or, if you just want to join two lists, you can do this:

```
L3 = L1 ++ L2.
L3 = [1,2] ++ [3,4]. % L3 = [1,2,3,4].
[1,2] ++ [3,4] = L3. % L3 = [1,2,3,4].
L3 := [1,2] ++ [3,4]. % L3 = [1,2,3,4].

```
This is deterministic and unifies or explicitly assigns `L1` followed by `L2` to `L3`. Again note that unification is bidirectional.

***Key point:*** The Picat manual identifies functions with the notation `= Val`, `= ResList` or similar. If you try to call a predicate like a function or visa-versa you will get an error an `undefined procedure` or a fail that you didn't expect.

For example:
```
A = append(1,2,3). % *** Undefined procedure: append/3
[3,4] = [1,2] ++ L2. println(L2). % Fails/false/no.

```

These seem like simple errors to avoid, but the distinction between a function that returns a value versus a predicate that unifies one or more of its arguments can be subtle. It's important to read the manual. 

For example to get a single solution or all solutions to a constraint programming problem the manual says:

- solve(Vars): This predicate ... a single solution
- solve_all(Vars) = Solutions ... all solutions

Calling `solver(MyVariable)` will unify `MyVariable` with the solution. In other words, you can `println(MyVariable)` to see the result.

But `solve_all(MyVariable)` gives a `** Error  : function_used_as_predicate:import(cp,solve_all / 2)`. You need to write something like `Sols = solve_all(MyVariable)`.

Note the reason for the difference is that before calling `solve`, `Vars` is a domain variable that has the shape of the solution. Solving binds `Vars` to the solution, so it is a predicate. All the solutions is a list, which is not the same shape as a single solution, and therefore needs to be assigned to a new variable. 

Don't worry if this doesn't make perfect sense yet. Personally this took me quite some time to understand.


#### Function calls: `()` and `.`

Functions can be called by placing arguments in parenthesis or by using dot notation. This is just syntactic sugar. The `.` notation makes the code a little shorter (1 character versus 2), and looks more like functional programming (or Rust) as opposed to lots of parentheses. You may find it easier to follow the logic with the dot notation, and you can mix-and-match the notations however you like.

For example:

```
% parentheses
Steps = map(my_parser,map(split,read_file_lines("day.txt"))),
init_bots(Steps,Bots,Bins),
Answer = prod(map(dec,take(3,(to_list(step([S : S in Steps, S[1]=$gives],Bots,Bins))))),

% dot notation
Steps = ("day.txt").read_file_lines.map(split).map(my_parser),
init_bots(Steps,Bots,Bins),
Answer = step([S : S in Steps, S[1]=$gives],Bots,Bins).to_list.take(3).map(dec).prod,

% mixed
Steps = read_file_lines("day.txt").map(split).map(my_parser),
% etc.

```


#### Statement delimiters

All statements have to end in `,`, `;` or `.` `,` means "and", `;` means "or" and `.` means "end of statement". `()` are used to mark a block of code. For example, as part of an `if` statement. 

```
A=2, B=3.
Name.length > 0; Name := "I'll just call you Larry.".
```

#### Control flow: `if` and `foreach`

`if` and `foreach` require an `end`. The statement just before this `end` doesn't need a `,`. Picat used to enforce this syntax, but doesn't anymore. The condition in `foreach` has to be enclosed in `()`. 

```
curve(Grade) = (Letter,Comment) => 
   	if Grade > 50 
    	then (Letter = A, Comment="Nice.") 
    	else (Letter = F, Comment="See me.") 
    end. 
```

The `then` keyword is optional if you enclose the condition in `()`

```
curve(Grade) = Letter => 
if (Grade > 50) (Letter = A) else (Letter = F) end. 
```


```                                                                                         % multiple iterators are allowed, they are treated like nested loops
foreach(X in 1..10, Y in 1..10) 
   	A[X,Y] := my_hash_function(X,Y) % <- comma optional
end.
```
#### Control flow: `;` operator, `cond` and `compare_terms`

procedures, functions


### Helper functions for accumlating results

....Haskell fold....


### Some control flow tricks

```
main =>
    Data = read_file_lines("day.txt").head,
 	cl_facts([$part(1)]), % a global fact
	printf("Part 1 Answer: %w\n",parse(Data).sum),

	cl_facts([$part(2)]), % override global fact
	printf("Part 2 Answer: %w\n",parse(Data).sum).

parse([]) = [].
parse([H|T]) = R =>
    if H = '(' then (R = parse1(T)) else (R = [1]++parse(T)) end.

parse1(L) = R =>
    Ix = find_first_of(L,'x'), Ip = find_first_of(L,')'),
    M = take(L,Ix-1).to_int, N = slice(L,Ix+1,Ip-1).to_int, 
    TT = slice(L,Ip+1+M),    % tail to leave
    part(Part),
    (Part = 1, R = [M*N]++parse(TT);
     Part = 2, R = [N*sum(parse(slice(L,Ip+1,Ip+M)))]++parse(TT)).')'


```

In this code the `parse` ...global variable
use of ; instead of it.
use of accumulator via helper function


## Non-determinism

A key feature of logic programming languages is implicit backtracking from failure to try and achieve success. This is also why they lend themselve to constraint programming. 

#### Lists


#### `?=>`


### Errors I Always Make and How I Compensate

#### Unification vs Assignment

Invariably I make an error where I use `=` when I need to use `:=`. This happens when I am editing code and moving things around and lose track of the first time I bind a variable versus when I either test it or mutate it. 

You could try to only ever use `:=` to do assignment and `==` to test equality. But without unification Picat is hobbled and there's no non-deterministic binding.


### Forgetting a comma or a period

Some people like to put the `,`, `;` and `.` at the start of lines. 

```
main =>
      A = 5
    , B = 10
    , if A > B 
        then println("Yoo")
        else println("Hoo")
      end
    .  

```
This can make it easier to move lines around, but I think it looks weird and it doesn't work in all cases.

Invariably, I add a new line of code and forget the comma. Picat is improving in its ability to locate the error, but it can be vague and give a large range of possible lines to check.

I compensate by adding only a few lines at a time and always saving and rerunning so that I don't have far to hunt for the most recent edit that broke syntax rules.

### Print and Printf are Your Friends

Picat lets you put a `println` anywhere, and I make extensive use of this when debugging.

println one variable
use of $

printf simplest format

## Appendix: Using Picat For Instruction

To use Picat with an autograder, the student code can be imported as a module into the grader. For example, students could be given the magic square problem from the Picat Constraint Solving book. 

Here's a sample assignment.

A magic square is one where the columns, rows and diagonals sum to the same number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square You are to code a constrain solving solution in Picat that has that sum be the "magic sum" of N*(N*N+1)//2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_constant Be sure to not change the code that says `module student.` at the top.

Use this code as your template:
```
module student. 
import cp.

magic(N) = Square =>
    NN = N*N,
    Sum = N*(NN+1)//2, % ensures consistency of solve
    Square = new_array(N,N),
    Square :: 1..NN,
    % your code here
    solve(Square)

```


Here's a potential full solution, this is from the Picat book. https://picat-lang.org/picatbook2015/constraint_solving_and_planning_with_picat.pdf

```
module student. 
import cp.

magic(N) = Square =>
    NN = N*N,
    Sum = N*(NN+1)//2,
    Square = new_array(N,N),
    Square :: 1..NN,
    all_different(Square.vars()), 
    foreach (I in 1..N)
        Sum #= sum([Square[I,J] : J in 1..N]), % rows
        Sum #= sum([Square[J,I] : J in 1..N]) % columns
    end,
    % diagonal sums
    Sum #= sum([Square[I,I] : I in 1..N]),
    Sum #= sum([Square[I,N-I+1] : I in 1..N]).
```

And the associated grader that puts the result into a file. Consistency in grading is ensured by using the combination of the magic sum and the set solve search method, in this caes: `[ffd,down]`. (Fail first with variable ordered by degree and down variables from largest to smallest.)

```
% grader.pi
import student.
import cp.

main =>
    Writer = open("grade_file.txt", write),
    Square = magic(5),
    solve([ffd,down],Square), % tell students the solve method
    if 
        Square == {{3,9,14,15,24},{10,20,22,2,11},{19,17,1,21,7},{8,13,16,23,5},{25,6,12,4,18}}
        then println(Writer,"Correct!") % or write to a file
        else println(Writer,"Wrong!")
    end.
```

## Appendix:  Things I Still Don't Fully Understand

The Picat manual can be terse and doesn't provide examples for everything. Here's some commands I don't know how to use.

- `reduce` I think this is a functional `fold`, but have not been able to make it work.
- `acyclic_term` "This predicate is true if Term is acyclic, meaning that Term does not contain itself." I don't know what this means or when I would use it.
- `list_to_and(List) = Conj` I understand that this turns a list into a conjunction of facts separated by and (`,`). For example: 

    ```
    M = [A=5,B=3,A!=B],
    C = list_to_and(M).
    -------
    M = [_13558 = 5,_13570 = 3,_13558 != _13570]
    C = (A = 5,B = 3,A != B)
    yes
    ```
    Which is neat, and kind of like building up an expression that can then be dynamically evaluated, but how do I evaluate `C`? I have no idea. This is the only use of `Conj` as an output value in the entire manual.
