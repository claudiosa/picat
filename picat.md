# What I Wish I Knew When Learning Picat

## Resources
- https://picat-lang.org/ -- Picat website
- https://picat-lang.org/download/picat_guide.pdf -- the manual
- https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Picat -- Rosetta Code examples of code to compare to a language you know
- https://hakank.org/picat/ -- The best resource of sample code


## Using the Manual
- The manual is the single most important document. It has everything, but can be very terse, and so must be read closely
- Not every function/predicate has an example
- The index at the back lists all the commands and hyperlinks to them
